# Code Walkabout

## Step 1. Scripting

Using a language of your choice write a script that does the following:

1. Downloads dataset at <https://data.ny.gov/api/views/e52k-ymww/rows.csv>
2. Displays the total number of each type of fish stocked.  
Bonus: Calculate the length of each type of fish stocked in miles :)

## Step 2. Containerization

- Create a Dockerfile that containerizes the above script.

---

## Step 3. CI/CD

- Describe how you would deploy the container to an infrastructure of your choice.

---

## Step 4: Documentation

- Document the build/execution instructions in a README file in your project.  
Provide a url to the interviewer with your completed project.
